# Which Vendor Prefix?

Displays all the css properties that need a vendor prefix. Based on [caniuse](https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse) data.

Still a work in progress.

I created this by looking through the caniuse data for anything that shows to require a vendor prefix. For some reason, things other than css properties show up on the list as well.

Also trying to work out how to use the caniuse data directly. At the moment I have had to download a local version because of the following error:

"XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fyrd/caniuse/master/data.json. The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'https://render.githubusercontent.com' that is not equal to the supplied origin. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access."

Any help appreciated!
