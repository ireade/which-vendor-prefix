# Which Vendor Prefix?

Displays all the css properties that need a vendor prefix. Based on [caniuse](https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse) data.

Still a work in progress.



Trying to work out how to use the caniuse data directly. At the moment I have had to download a local version because of the following error:

"XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fyrd/caniuse/master/data.json. The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'https://render.githubusercontent.com' that is not equal to the supplied origin. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access."

Any help appreciated!
